## AA Scraper

### Installation

* `git clone` the repository
* navigate to _Assignment #6_ in the terminal
* `npm install` 
* `export GMAKEY="your_api_key"`
* `node index.js` to run

_Caveat_: Cloud9 comes with an outdated version of `node` by default, so this will not run until node is updated by running `nvm install stable` in the terminal. 

### Querying (Assignment 5)

* `node query.js` after completing installation
